This repository implements a saliency map as well as a smoothGrad on a cnn. The dataset used is the cats vs dogs one from the kaggle competition linked here : (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats/).
This notebook is executed in colab so keep that in mind (easily reproducible as kaggle's api is used to retrieve the data). If you're not using colab, the data preparation process will need some tweaking.
